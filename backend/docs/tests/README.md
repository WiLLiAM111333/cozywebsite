# Documentation of unit tests

The purpose of documenting these unit tests is mainly for me but it also helps people learning to code. I will be describing why I test what I test and the logic behind it to make it as clear as possible. I will also be documenting why I didnt test certain things. This will NOT have dumbed down language to make it easier to understand for beginners as I intend to make it indept and CLEAR for a nerd like myself to know EXACTLY what's going on.

The comments in the test files provided are not there in the originals, they are actually copy pasted and modified to have comments. ðŸ˜‡

Testing framework used [JestJS](https://jestjs.io/)
